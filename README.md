Note to Corrector!
--------------------
Due to lack of time, I could not implement everything I wanted. I left what I still wanted to in TODO's in the comments.
If there is still a possibility to work on it next week I would be more than happy!
If you have any questions, or if there are other things I could still improve on, feel free to contact me on Slack!
